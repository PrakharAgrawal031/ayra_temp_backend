  "evaluation_notes": "This case tests ability to: (1) identify multiple preventive care gaps across different body systems, (2) recognize high-risk features requiring intervention (family history + elevated LDL), (3) track incidental findings requiring follow-up, (4) understand that patient reports of 'will schedule' without action represent a care gap requiring system-level intervention, (5) apply screening guidelines based on age and risk factors, and (6) recognize that seemingly healthy patients can have significant unaddressed health risks. The LLM should flag multiple care gaps at V1 (overdue mammogram, colonoscopy, consideration for statin), identify the thyroid nodule at V2 as requiring follow-up, and by V3 recognize a pattern of preventive care avoidance requiring more proactive intervention. This case emphasizes that absence of symptoms does not equal absence of risk, and that systematic tracking of preventive care is essential."

The LLM should flag GDM risk factors at V1, recognize borderline glucose at V2, identify GDM diagnosis and need for treatment at V3, understand poor control requiring insulin at V4, recognize worsening hypertension and preeclampsia risk at V5, and critically identify at V6 that postpartum glucose testing has NOT been done despite clear indication. This case emphasizes the importance of follow-up testing after pregnancy complications that increase future disease risk."

The LLM should flag concern at V3 with elevated BP and edema, recognize preeclampsia diagnosis at V4, identify rapid progression and severe features at V5 requiring emergency intervention, and understand at V6 the implications for future pregnancy and cardiovascular health. This case demonstrates how quickly preeclampsia can progress from mild to life-threatening."

The LLM should flag inappropriate medications and fall risk at V1, recognize worsening trajectory with recurrent falls at V2-V3, identify the serious consequence at V4, and understand the appropriate deprescribing and care planning at V5.

The LLM should flag rapid cognitive decline at V2 (6-point SLUMS drop in 3 months), recognize urgent need for imaging and neurology, identify severe caregiver stress and safety concerns by V3-V4, understand the severity of weight loss and malnutrition throughout, and appreciate the appropriate shift to comfort care at V5.

  "evaluation_notes": "This case tests ability to: (1) recognize clinical patterns despite incomplete data, (2) identify data quality issues that impede optimal care, (3) understand that missing documentation represents care gaps, (4) make appropriate inferences from available information while acknowledging uncertainty, (5) track clinical progression despite fragmented records, and (6) maintain appropriate confidence levels when data is incomplete or conflicting. The LLM should recognize persistent RUQ pain across visits, identify the missing ultrasound results from V1-V2 as a care gap, note the incomplete documentation at V2, recognize the progression to acute cholecystitis at V3, and identify missing surgical records at V4. This case emphasizes that real-world medical records often have significant data quality issues, and AI systems must handle uncertainty appropriately while still identifying important clinical patterns and care gaps. The LLM should flag lower confidence scores for correlations due to missing data, but still recognize the overall clinical trajectory toward cholecystitis diagnosis and treatment."
