The LLM should flag concern at V3 with elevated BP and edema, recognize preeclampsia diagnosis at V4, identify rapid progression and severe features at V5 requiring emergency intervention, and understand at V6 the implications for future pregnancy and cardiovascular health. This case demonstrates how quickly preeclampsia can progress from mild to life-threatening."

The LLM should flag high stroke risk at V2 when AFib is diagnosed, identify the care gap of delayed anticoagulation at V2-V3, recognize subtherapeutic INR as critical finding at V4, connect poor adherence with stroke occurrence, and understand the improved safety/adherence profile with DOAC switch at V5.

The LLM should flag recurrent pattern by V2, recognize inadequate response to medical therapy by V3, identify need for imaging and ENT referral, understand CT findings showing severe disease at V4, and appreciate successful surgical outcome and prevention strategies at V5.

The LLM should flag initial pharyngitis treatment at V1, recognize dramatic worsening and airway emergency at V2, understand polymicrobial infection and bacteremia at V3, identify successful treatment response at V4, and appreciate complete resolution with tonsillectomy at V5.

  "evaluation_notes": "This case tests ability to: (1) recognize hypertensive emergency (BP >180/120 WITH acute end-organ damage) vs urgency (elevated BP without damage), (2) identify multiple end-organ injuries (brain, kidney, eye, heart), (3) understand medication non-adherence as root cause, (4) recognize 18-month care gap and its consequences, (5) identify social determinants as critical barriers to care, (6) understand that some organ damage is permanent despite later excellent control, (7) track progression from Stage 3b to Stage 4 CKD approaching dialysis, (8) appreciate need for comprehensive support addressing insurance, medication access, and social needs, and (9) understand this as preventable catastrophe. The LLM should flag uncontrolled hypertension and medication non-adherence at V1, identify 18-month gap and recognize life-threatening emergency with multi-organ damage at V2, understand ICU management and partial recovery at V3, track improved control but permanent damage at V4, and recognize long-term consequences (approaching dialysis) despite excellent subsequent adherence at V5. This case emphasizes that hypertension is 'silent killer' until catastrophic complications occur, and addressing social barriers is essential for management."
