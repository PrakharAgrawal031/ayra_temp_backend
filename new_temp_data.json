        "Primary Clinical Concern": "The primary clinical concern was an intrauterine pregnancy (G1P0) complicated by the rapid onset and progression of preeclampsia, culminating in severe preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome requiring emergency delivery at 32 weeks. The patient presented for her first prenatal visit at 10 weeks, and by 28 weeks, developed elevated blood pressure and edema, raising concerns for preeclampsia. By 31 weeks, preeclampsia without severe features was diagnosed. One week later, at 32 weeks, her condition acutely worsened with severe headache, visual changes, and right upper quadrant pain, leading to a diagnosis of severe preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome. An emergency Cesarean section was performed. Post-delivery, the patient recovered well, with normalization of lab values and blood pressure by her 6-week postpartum visit, though she remains at high risk for future cardiovascular issues and preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies."

Magnesium sulfate and Labetalol were started for seizure prophylaxis and BP control, respectively, at the time of severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, in conjunction with Betamethasone for fetal lung maturity. The definitive treatment of delivery for severe preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome led to a resolution of the severe symptoms and normalization of blood pressure and lab abnormalities postpartum."
